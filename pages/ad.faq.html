        <h4>What is a testnet? </h4>
        Testnets are versions of the blockchains used for testing purposes, testnet coins are worthless and very easy to obtain.

<section>
    <h4>Who handles my coins? You? Am i supposed to trust you?</h4>
    No, we don't handle players' coins. Every server that choose to run Reddconomy
    will have to setup its own independent  and private wallet, your coins will go there. 
    <br />
    In short, you'll have to trust the admin and staff of the server where you play, that are the solely responsible for
     keeping your coins safe, not us.

        <h4>Does Reddconomy involve mining?</h4>
        No.
</section>

<section>
        <h4>Is Reddconomy against the eula?</h4>
       The eula forbid the server owner from selling items and powerups. 
       In our original conception, Reddconomy is designed to allow player to player trading, not server to players shops, and, in
       our understanding, the eula does not explicitly forbid that.
        <br />
        However, there might be other country laws and 
        regulations that you and/or your users must comply, for example the anti money laundering laws.
        <br />
        It's your solely responsibility to ensure that you are complying to all the laws you are required to.

<section>
    <h4>So, if I can't sell items, how do I monetize my server? </h4>
    Reddconomy allows server owners to set fixed or proportional fees for deposits, withdrawals and transactions. 
    <br />
    Basically you'll earn from taxation.
    <br />
    If you use a coin that rewards for stacking (like reddcoin) you'll also earn staking rewards calculated on the overall sum of every player's deposit.

<section>
    <h4>Do you support only Reddcoin?</h4>
    No, reddcoin is our main target but we believe that different cryptocurrencies can coexist, just like fiat, 
 for this reason we will support other coins as well. <br />
 We are already supporting every coin that has a bitcoind compatible RPC api.
