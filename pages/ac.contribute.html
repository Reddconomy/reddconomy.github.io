    <h4>Contribute as a Server Owner</h4>
    You can configure your server to run Reddconomy on testnet  (Testnet is a version of the blockchain used for testing purposes, its coins are worth nothing in the real world), you'll have your in-game currency while helping us with a real life test
    scenario.
